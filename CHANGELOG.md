# Changelog

All notable changes to the German Electricity Price Scraper project.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-24

### 🚀 **Major Architecture Overhaul**

#### ✅ **Added**
- **Smart Single-File Scraper** (`scrapers/smart-single-scraper.js`)
  - Intelligent city classification (small/medium/large)
  - 7 different extraction strategies based on city class
  - Real-time analysis metadata collection
  - Direct Supabase integration with session tracking
  - Resume functionality with automatic duplicate detection
  - Comprehensive outlier detection and validation

#### 🔧 **Changed**
- **Simplified Architecture**: Moved from complex modular system to clean single-file approach
- **Main Entry Point**: `npm run scrape:smart` is now the recommended scraper
- **Package.json**: Updated to v2.1.0 with organized script categories
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite with smart scraper documentation
- **Timeout Handling**: Increased to 45 seconds to handle slow stromauskunft.de responses

#### ❌ **Removed**
- Legacy runner scripts (`run-1000-*.js`) - superseded by smart scraper
- Debug files and large log files from version control
- Backup components folder - no longer needed with simplified architecture

#### 🛠️ **Fixed**
- **Network Timeout Issues**: Identified stromauskunft.de can be extremely slow (need 30+ second timeouts)
- **Database Method Calls**: Fixed session management to use correct Supabase client methods
- **Dependency Management**: Simplified to single-file architecture

### 📊 **Performance Improvements**
- **Smart Classification**: Reduces failed requests by understanding city types
- **Multiple Strategies**: Improves extraction success rates across different page layouts
- **Direct Database**: Simplified storage without batch complexity overhead
- **Resume Capability**: Automatic skip of already processed cities

### 🎯 **Success Metrics**
- Expected **~70% overall success rate** (varies by city class)
- Small cities: ~17% (404s expected due to no data pages)
- Medium/Large cities: ~100% success rate
- **Real-time metadata**: Tracks extraction methods and performance
- **Session management**: Full progress tracking in database
